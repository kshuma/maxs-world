# Max's World: The Game

## Objective 

- Create a fun, education, non-violent game that younger kids can enjoy.
  - Share Max's love of animals and "Pokemon"-style games.
  - Create game play that is simply and retro-cool (ok, Max's dad wants to do the retro-thing)

- Accumulate treasure (gold coins) that let you buy things from the in-game store.  Such as gaming upgrades (new outfits, new emotes, etc.).
