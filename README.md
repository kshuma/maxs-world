# Max's World: The Game

## Objective 

- Create a fun, education, non-violent game that younger kids can enjoy.
  - Share Max's love of animals and "Pokemon"-style games.
  - Create game play that is simply and retro-cool (ok, Max's dad wants to do the retro-thing)

- Accumulate treasure (gold coins) that let you buy things from the in-game store.  Such as gaming upgrades (animal powers, new outfits, new emotes, etc.).

- Player's can spend their treasure on animal power juiceboxes that they can put in their backpack.  Then when necessary, drink the juice to gain a power for a short-period of time; these powers include:
  - Ability to take on a birds wings and fly over danger
  - Ability to take on an aligators skin and be invisible to danger  

- Instead of the typical weapons, Max's World will have "phasers" that shoot a beam of light that causes anyone it touches to do something silly for a short-period of time
  - Player is encapsulated in a bubble and floats away
  - Player is shrunk to one inch tall
  - Player is given rubber bones and flops around uncontrollably 
  - Moves the player around so you can put them down on the top of a building
  - Player is bent over farting jellybeans
  - Player is puking rainbows

- Players have "health" level, when it gets to zero they gain a strike
  - The game is over when a player has 3 strikes
